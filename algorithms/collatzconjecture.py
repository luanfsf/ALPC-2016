"""Start with a positive number n and repeatedly apply these simple rules:

If n = 1, stop.
If n is even, divide n by 2.
If n is odd, multiply n by 3 and add 1.

In 1937, Lothar Collatz asked whether this procedure always
stops for every positive starting value of n. If Gerhard Opfer
is correct, we can finally say that indeed it always stops."""
